  Hello Developer!
  If you are reading this, it means that you have found your way
  to the mothermodem - the heart of a the server.

  I left my pebble debugging toolsbox down here somehwere, and it contains
  quite powerful stuff.

  Like for instance the True Hammer of Sanity.

  Use it carefully and responsibly and only on your own pebbles,
  or you might end up with unexpected facts.

    Hello World!

    I don't know how to cure virii or produce TP, but I can
    engineer their digital counterpart.
    This one is designed to attack your "meh"-recepticles
    and stimulate your _PERCEPTION_ of reality.

    Your mood pebble is pseudo anonymous, meaning it's securely
    encrypted until an autonomous statistical witness or a heartless
    dickwad decrypts it using the public secret `K0`.
    K0 is attached at the bottom of this document but
    don't worry I've enclosed it in a strong cryptomantic seal.
    Your pebbles are safe!

    If you can help build the ASW or do the data-cleanup or analysis or
    make cool diagrams'n'shit - please Join me!
    (Actually if you're a virus fan like me, then you're welcome to)

    Survive and stay comfty~

          Dear user, you are wise to not trust everyone.

          This app sadly relies on your browser's JavaScript,
          but the good news is that the only scripts used here
          are the Free and Open kind, the app it self is licensed as AGPL.
          Please check source-code at: https://github.com/telamon/survive.click

          I will eventually release a CLI version of this app so you can enjoy
          generating pico-links from your terminal :>

          But until then, might I persuade you whitelist this domain?
          Btw we don't use any analytics or nasty profiling trackers.

          Also here are the keys:
